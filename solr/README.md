##Solr directory

Add overrides for VIVO's Solr here.  

Your additions should follow the structure from Vitro here:
https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro/tree/develop/solr

For example, to change Solr's `schema.xml`, you would add your version of schema.xml at `./solr/homeDirectoryTemplate/conf/schema.xml`.
